Excited by the unlimited possibilities in applying machine learning frameworks to biology. During my undergraduate years (freshman at UIUC, then at Cornell), I have been extremely fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Buz Barstow](https://barstow.bee.cornell.edu) and
Prof. [Chris De Sa](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cdesa/) @Cornell, and Prof. [Huimin Zhao](http://faculty.scs.illinois.edu/~zhaogrp/)
@UIUC.

#UPDATE# Starting this fall, I will be an PhD student at UC Berkeley and will be affiliated with [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/).

My research interest lies broadly in the power set of {*synthetic biology*, *AI4Science*,
*generative models*, *deep learning*}.  I have been working on projects involving 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), 
ML-guided directed evolution (MLDE), representation learning, and generative models.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
